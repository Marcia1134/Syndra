# The Syndra Project

Syndra, the open-source community manager, helps you get your ideas out into the world and bring together people who are ready to share their work. 

## What's the Syndra Project?

Syndra is a portable monetization solution. We help communities create better, higher-quality content that anyone can support with ease. Syndra offers tools specifically designed for creators, to help with outreach, growth, and content development. We are a set of tools, focused on making the money side of creative arts, something you don't need to worry about. We are a trade center, a community broadcaster, a marketplace, plus so much more! Syndra is focusing on high customizability and user experience, trying to make sharing your work easier and more financially viable!

## What can we expect in the future?

Syndra is at the beginning stages right now, but we are off to a rocketing start! Coming soon to Syndra are integrations with third-party monetization options, offline shopping and trading, more advanced trading features, and so much more! Our team is only comprised of one contracted developer at the moment, so things might not move like lightning, but we are working as fast as possible to push out quality updates! If you'd like to contribute to or work on the project in any way, please let us know by sending us an email (contact info found below).
